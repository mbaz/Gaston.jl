TODO: explain about pluto notebooks, add ack to other packages

[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is a venerable (but actively
developed), very powerful and fast program for plotting.
[Julia](https://julialang.org) is a very powerful language for numerical
computing.  [Gaston](https://github.com/mbaz/Gaston.jl) is a package for
plotting Julia data and functions using gnuplot.

The following diagram illustrates how Gaston works. On the left there is a
gnuplot script; the equivalent Gaston function call is on the right.

The data to plot is in green color. In gnuplot, the data can be provided
inline as a _data block_ (as in this example), or it can be provided in a
separate file. Gaston can plot data stored in arrays (`x` and `y` in this
example). Gaston also supports recipes to plot arbitrary Julia types.

The lines in red specify the _axes settings_, affecting things like the
presence of a grid, the title, the legend box, tics positions/labels, etc.
Finally, in blue color, the _plot settings_ or _plotline_ specify the
properties of one specific curve within the axes (for example, the line
color, thickness and style, which marker to use, etc.)

There is a close correspondence between gnuplot and Gaston commands; in
fact, the main purpose of Gaston is to translate the Julia code on the
right to the gnuplot commands on the left. Gaston has two main features:

* It provides convenient, flexible syntax for plotting, along with common
  2-D and 3-D plot styles.
* It provides a simple mechanism to add user-defined recipes for plotting
  arbitrary Julia types.

Other features are:

* Support for plotting in separate GUI windows, in the terminal (with text
  or [sixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel)), in VS Code, or in
  notebooks (such as Jupyter and Pluto).
* Handling multiple co-existing interactive GUI plot windows.
* Support for (user-defined) themes.
* Convenient commands for common types of plots (like histograms, contour
  plots, surface plots, heatmaps, etcetera).
* Convenient syntax for creating multiplots and animations.
* Saving plots to multiple formats, including pdf, png and svg.
* Integrated color palettes from
  [ColorSchemes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorSchemes.jl).

## Learning gnuplot

This documentation assumes at least a basic understanding of gnuplot. Some
pointers to get started with gnuplot are:

* The [official documentation](http://www.gnuplot.info/documentation.html).
* The [official list of tutorials](http://www.gnuplot.info/help.html).
* [Plotting data](http://www.gnuplotting.org/plotting-data/) article on
  [gnuplotting.org](http://www.gnuplotting.org/).
* [A blog post about Gaston by Julia
  Frank](https://juliaifrank.com/gnuplot-with-julia-for-beautiful-graphics/).
* Stackoverflow has a [gnuplot
  tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gnuplot) with answers to
  more than 6,500 questions.

The following are interesting plot galleries:

## Installation

Gaston v2.x requires Julia version 1.8.0 or above (Gaston v1.x supports
Julia 1.6 and above), and has been tested with gnuplot versions 5 and 6.
You should manually install gnuplot on your system prior to using Gaston.
On Linux, it is highly recommended that you select a version with Qt
support: on Debian and Ubuntu, you will need `gnuplot-qt`. On Arch and its
derivatives, a simple `pacman -S gnuplot` suffices.  Gnuplot also supports
Windows and Mac.

To install Gaston from the Julia REPL, run
```julia
julia> ]add Gaston
```
Typing `]` switches the Julia REPL to the package manager, and the `add`
command installs the package. To exit the package manager, hit the backspace
key.
Load Gaston into your Julia session with
```julia
using Gaston
```

## Specifying the location of gnuplot

    The location of the gnuplot executable can be specified with the environmental variable
    `JULIA_GNUPLOT_EXE`. If gnuplot is in the system's path, setting this variable is not
    necessary.

## Support

Here are some ideas on what to do if you need help with Gaston:

* Post a question in [Julia's discuss forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/tag/plotting)
  in the "plotting" category.
* Chat with the author (@mbaz) on [Julia's Zulip chat forum](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/),
  in the "plotting" or "helpdesk" channels.
* Bug reports, suggestions and pull requests are welcome at
  [Gaston's github page](https://github.com/mbaz/Gaston.jl).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Examples of things you can do are bug reports,
improvements to the documentation, new examples and tutorials, and new features or
suggestions.

## Gnuplot startup file

Gnuplot reads and executes a startup file, if it exists, before every plot.
Since an un-configured gnuplot produces plots that are less than attractive,
the following minimum configuration is suggested (and was used to generate the
plots in this document):

    set linetype 1 lc rgb "blue" pt 3
    set linetype 2 lc rgb "red" pt 4
    set linetype 3 lc rgb "green" pt 6
    set linetype 4 lc rgb "black" pt 12
    set linetype 5 lc rgb "blue" pt 5
    set linetype 6 lc rgb "red" pt 1
    set linetype 7 lc rgb "green" pt 2
    set linetype 8 lc rgb "black" pt 7
    set linetype cycle 8
    set style data lines
    set key noautotitle
    set auto fix
    set offsets graph .05, graph .05, graph .05, graph .05

The configuration file is `~/.gnuplot` on Unix-like systems, and
`%APPDATA%\GNUPLOT.INI` on Windows.
